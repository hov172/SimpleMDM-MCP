# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- **MCP tool annotations** on every tool: `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
  `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, plus a human-friendly `title`. Reads are
  annotated read-only; writes are annotated mutations; `wipe_device`,
  `unenroll_device`, all `delete_*`, and the `clear_*` password tools are
  flagged destructive so clients can render an extra confirmation step.
- **MCP Resources** — 8 canonical report URIs served alongside tools:
  `simplemdm://fleet/summary`, `.../reports/security-posture`,
  `.../reports/os-versions`, `.../reports/enrollment`,
  `.../reports/filevault`, `.../inventory/devices`,
  `.../inventory/assignment-groups`, `.../inventory/apps`.
- **MCP Prompts** — 6 workflow templates selectable from the MCP client UI:
  `fleet-health-dashboard`, `security-audit`, `new-device-onboarding`,
  `device-offboarding`, `patch-compliance-review`, `stale-devices-cleanup`.
  Prompts with destructive steps (offboarding) do not call write tools
  without explicit user confirmation.
- **Compound tools** to reduce LLM round-trips:
  - `get_device_full_profile` — device + profiles + installed apps + users
    + recent logs in parallel (accepts device_id or serial_number).
  - `get_security_posture` — fleet-wide percentages and counts for every
    posture metric + OS-major breakdown in one call.
- Full tool catalog documentation in README (~117 tools grouped by domain).
- Setup instructions for Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, and ChatGPT connectors.
- Rate-limit guidance and error-behavior notes.
- `LICENSE` file (MIT) at repo root.
- `.nvmrc` pinning Node 20 for local dev consistency.
- GitHub Actions CI that builds the project on push and pull requests.
- `files` allowlist in `package.json` so `npm publish` only ships runtime artifacts.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates, PR template, Dependabot config.

### Changed
- Server now advertises the `resources` and `prompts` capabilities.
- Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.29.0`.
- Hardened `.dockerignore` to exclude `.env`, `.env.*`, and `.claude/`.

### Removed
- README references to Report-SimpleMDM local app mode and SimpleMDM-MunkiReport
  enrichment. Server-side scaffolding remains behind undocumented env vars
  pending companion-app support.

## [0.2.0] - Prior release
- Initial public release on npm with core read tools, write gating, and Docker/npm/source install paths.
