[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Full tool catalog documentation in README (~115 tools grouped by domain).
- Setup instructions for Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, and ChatGPT connectors.
- Rate-limit guidance and error-behavior notes.
- `LICENSE` file (MIT) at repo root.
- `.nvmrc` pinning Node 20 for local dev consistency.
- GitHub Actions CI that builds the project on push and pull requests.
- `files` allowlist in `package.json` so `npm publish` only ships runtime artifacts.

### Changed
- Hardened `.dockerignore` to exclude `.env`, `.env.*`, and `.claude/`.

### Removed
- README references to Report-SimpleMDM local app mode and SimpleMDM-MunkiReport
  enrichment. Server-side scaffolding remains behind undocumented env vars
  pending companion-app support.

## [0.2.0] - Prior release
- Initial public release on npm with core read tools, write gating, and Docker/npm/source install paths.
